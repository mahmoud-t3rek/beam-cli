# CLI (NestJS Commander)

## Prompt 
This application serves as the primary entry point for user interaction via the terminal.
It must be implemented using **NestJS Commander**.

### Core Responsibilities:
1.  **Command Parsing**: Use `nest-commander` to define commands and sub-commands.
2.  **User Input**: Integrate `inquirer` or `yargs` to collect user flags and interactive inputs.
3.  **Backend Communication**: It should act as a client that triggers processes in the backend.

### Technical Stack:
- Framework: NestJS
- Lib: nest-commander
